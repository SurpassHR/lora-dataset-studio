"""SeedVR2 high-resolution lane — tiling, and the ceiling that warns first.

WHY THIS EXISTS. SurpassHR (GitHub #32) hit a real CUDA OOM upscaling full-frame
on an 11.6 GB card and shipped a tiled workflow on his fork that reaches >4K on
the same machine. Two things came out of that report, and both are tested here:
the tiled lane itself, and the fact that a user must be TOLD where the limit is
before a run dies rather than discovering it in a PyTorch traceback.

WHAT WAS DELIBERATELY NOT PORTED. His graph chains three node packs; two of them
only do arithmetic (normalise a pixel count, divide by 1024 to count tiles), and
one of those two is GPL-3.0 while this repo is MIT and has refused a dependency
over its licence before. The arithmetic lives in `tile_plan` instead, so the
lane needs TTP alone — MIT, two classes. These tests pin that reduction: if
someone re-adds a pack, `test_the_tiled_graph_needs_only_the_two_TTP_nodes`
fails.
