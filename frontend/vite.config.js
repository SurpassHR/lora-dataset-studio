/* Where `npm run dev` sends /api.
 *
 * This used to be the literal string below, hard-coded — and 127.0.0.1:5050 is
 * where the app you actually USE is listening. So a dev server started to try a
 * UI change drove the real install: every POST, every delete, every training
 * launch landed in real data. It worked, which is exactly the problem — nothing
 * ever said which backend was being talked to.
 *
 * The default is unchanged, so the habit ("npm run dev", hit :5173) still works.
 * Point it somewhere else with LDS_DEV_API_TARGET, in the shell or in
 * frontend/.env.local:
 *
 *     LDS_DEV_API_TARGET=http://127.0.0.1:5051 npm run dev
 *
 * Prefixed LDS_ rather than VITE_ on purpose: VITE_* variables are inlined into
 * the CLIENT bundle, and this is a dev-server setting that has no business
 * shipping in built output. */
