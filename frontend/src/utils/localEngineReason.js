/* Why a LOCAL engine (Klein, Krea 2 Edit) can't run on THIS install — one
   answer, shared by every surface that offers those engines.
   PURE JS (no JSX) so `node --test` can exercise it directly.

   WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
   --------------------
   The generation panel had computed Klein's reason inline for a long time, and
   Krea's in utils/kreaEngine.js. That was fine while the generation panel was the
   only place you could pick a local engine. The ✦ Edit-reference modal now offers
   them too, and a second inline copy is how "⚠ Configure ComfyUI in Settings"
   ends up worded one way in one dialog and another way two clicks later — for the
   same missing file. So the reason moved HERE and both callers read it.

   Every branch answers one question: what is the ONE thing to do next? "Not
   available" is an inert button; the user cannot tell a missing weight from a
   stopped ComfyUI from a node pack that needs a restart. */
import { kreaUnavailableReason } from './kreaEngine.js';
import { comfyEnumUnavailableReason } from './comfyEnumSupport.js';
// The REQUIRED-weights vocabulary already exists, next to the Setup step that
// downloads them. Re-listing it here is how the picker and Setup end up naming
// different files for one gap; the recommended LoRA stays excluded there for the
// right reason (optional + auto-fetched, so naming it sends the user nowhere).

/** Why Klein can't be picked, or null when it can. Ordered by what has to be
 *  fixed FIRST — a disabled engine and an unreachable ComfyUI both make the asset
 *  list meaningless.
 *
 *  The enum gap comes BEFORE the weights: a reachable ComfyUI with every file in
 *  place can still refuse a widget VALUE the graph pins (the `beta57` scheduler
 *  took Klein out for everyone without the RES4LYF pack while every other check
 *  went green). Naming the weights there sends the user to re-check a step that
 *  was already correct.
 *
 *  `invalidAssets` is the branch this function was MISSING, and its absence is
 *  what reported a 9.5 GB file on disk as "Klein model missing" (zigzag4794,
 *  Discord): a truncated download is present, so no weight is named, and the
 *  sentence fell through to the catch-all. Krea has had this branch since its
 *  own licence-gate incident — Klein now says the same thing, from the same

/** THE readiness verdict for a local engine — one question, one answer, for every
 *  screen that asks it.
 *
 *  WHY THIS EXISTS (and why Setup must not compute its own)
 *  --------------------------------------------------------
 *  `engines.klein` / `engines.krea` are computed by the BACKEND, from five
 *  conditions for Klein (ComfyUI reachable, no unsupported widget value, the UNET
 *  + text encoder + VAE all resolvable, no blocking-invalid required weight) and
 *  four for Krea. The Setup wizard used to re-derive its own version of that from
 *  the raw ingredients, and the install menu judged each file on presence alone —
 *  so a truncated 9.5 GB UNET read "✓ Installed" on one screen while the
 *  generation page refused the engine on the next. Two screens, both sincere,
 *  contradicting each other, with the user sent to fix the one thing that was
 *  fine.
 *
 *  So: the backend verdict is the truth, this reads it, and everything else reads
 *  this. Nothing here recomputes readiness — `reason` only EXPLAINS a verdict it
 *  was given.
 *
 *  Returns:
 *    ready    — the engine can be used right now (the backend said so);
 *    verified — whether the checks that need a live ComfyUI could actually RUN.
 *               False means "not checked", which is not the same as "checked and
 *               fine" and must never render as a ✓. The unsupported-value probe
 *               fails OPEN by design (an unreachable ComfyUI reports no gap rather
 *               than inventing one); this flag is how a screen says so out loud
 *               instead of inheriting a silent all-clear.
 *    reason   — null when ready, else the ONE shared sentence naming the real gap. */
